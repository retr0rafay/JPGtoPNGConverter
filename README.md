# JPGtoPNGConverter
## Running the Script
1. The first thing you should do is download the script from this repo
2. Once you have it, make sure you know where your JPG image files live
3. After that, open up your terminal and run `python3 JPGtoPNGconverter.py <source_dir> <destination_dir>`
4. Once you run this command, you should have your brand new PNG files in the destination directory that you specify
5. If you type in the wrong source directory, the program will quit and you will need to run it again
